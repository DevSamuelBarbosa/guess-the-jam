# 🎵 Guess the Jam

A local party music guessing game built with Next.js. One host screen, multiple teams, and a YouTube playlist — guess the song title and artist to score points!

## How It Works

1. **Setup** — The host pastes a YouTube playlist link, creates up to 3 teams, and picks a playback duration (1, 3, or 5 seconds).
2. **Countdown** — A 10-second countdown builds the hype before the game begins.
3. **Rounds** — Each round plays a random song snippet from the playlist. Teams take turns guessing the song name and artist.
4. **Scoring** — The host verifies answers manually. A correct guess earns 1 point; an incorrect guess passes the chance to the next team.
5. **Winning** — The first team to reach **10 points** wins the game!

## Game Rules

- The playlist must contain at least **10 songs**.
- Songs are shuffled once at the start and are never repeated.
- Playback duration is configurable: **1s**, **3s** (default), or **5s**.
- Up to **3 teams** can play.
- The host controls the entire flow from a single screen — no player devices needed.
